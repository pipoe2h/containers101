# Lab11 - Kubernetes Services
The objective of this lab is to get a basic knowledge about how to use Kubernetes Services.

For this lab you need to access to your virtual machine to run the *kubectl* commands.

## Services
For this exercise we are going to expose a simple webapp. Follow the exercise available in Kubernetes website:

* [Use a Service to Access an Application in a Cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/service-access-application-cluster/)

**Note:** Make sure you deploy the Kubernetes objects in the **default** namespace.
